# Research-Module-Generating-map-using-BaseMap-querying-the-MSD-via-hdf5_getters
This research module goes into the process of creating a map image using BaseMap, a module from MatPlotLib. It also displays how to abstract data from the million song database (MSD), which is powered by EchoNest, using the script:hdf5_getters.py. hdf5_getters provides several different methods to get artist/song/other attributes data from a track by querying the MSD, such as: artist_i.d., artist_hotnesss, artist_location, get_title, get_similar_artists, and many others. The hdf5_getter module works in cooperation within the getTrackData.py script with the os and glob modules. os and glob are Python standard library modules. This research module includes both the script used to produce the map image via basemap, as well as the getTrackData.py script, and goes into detail about each
